This module was made possible by 2 great developers. The original cloning script was developed by Sudhaker for the SmartSection module.
It was then improved by Solo who encapsulated Sudhaker's code into an easy web form interface for his Edito module.
It was only after Solo have shown Marcan his latest Edito that he had the idea to create a module that could clone any module
in a '1 click operation'. Many thanks to Sudhaker and Solo for they made this module possible!

Version 1.10 was updated to XOOPS 2.5.0 Standard GUI by Mamba
